    "## Research question #1: What is the relationship between life satisfaction and loneliness? \n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "- WELLNESS_life_satisfaction: On a scale of 1 to 10, How do you feel about your life as a whole right now?\n",
    "- LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated: Indicate how often each of the statements below is descriptive of you.  How often do you feel isolated from others?\n",
    "### Why these variables are useful:\n",
    "Since I plan on using a linear regression model, I specifically chose variables with numerical values. \n",
    "The correlation on these two variables may provide insight on how the effect of social isolation may affect their outlook on life. \n",
    "Firstly, I would use box plots for both variables WELLNESS_life_satisfaction and  LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated as this would show the spread of data in each category. \n",
    "I would like to know the spread as for the trend line, I would like to have data from many different responses. \n",
    "Then I would find the size of each category as this would help understand the  amount of data in each category. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis: Linear regression modelling:\n",
    "First, adding the dataset to a data frame and then exclude null data within the 2 columns of data I am investigating. I would then import statsmodels and then use .ols() / the ordinary least squares to specify linear regressions. Here I would specify that the column LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated is the ‘x’ value and WELLNESS_life_satisfaction is the y value. Next, I would use the .fit() method to provide the fitted model from the dataset. To then retrieve the correlation between the two variables, I will use the .rsquared attribute and .summary to understand the model summary for more details. I will also graph the model along with the data points in order to visualize the dataset. \n",
    "### Model Assumptions:\n",
    "Linearity: Verify if the relationship between the variables is linear (you can check by inspecting the scatter plot), Homoscedasticity: Check if the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) are evenly distributed. This can be checked through residual plots and Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This can be checked using a histogram plot of the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis: \n",
    "There is a strong correlation ( R squared value greater than 0.7) between the life satisfaction variable and the loneliness scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question #2: Does the frequency of meaningful social interactions influence feelings of loneliness during the past week?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "CONNECTION_meaningful_interactions: This variable measures how often someone has meaningful social interactions. \n",
    "LONELY_direct: This variable measures whether a person has felt lonely during the past week. \n",
    "Firstly, I would visuallize the variables by using boxplots to show the spread, using the null attribute to understand how many null datasets there are within this variable and also \n",
    "### Analysis: Linear regression modelling:\n",
    "In order to find the linear regression model, I would follow these steps: First, adding the dataset to a data frame and then exclude null data within the 2 columns of data I am investigating. I would then import statsmodels and then use .ols() / the ordinary least squares to specify linear regressions.

    "## Research question #3: What is the impact of the number of close friends on mental health outcomes?\n",
    "### Variables used: \n",
    "WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health: At the present time, would you say your MENTAL HEALTH is and CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends_p3m: Over the past three months, how many people belonging to each of the following categories have you spent time socializing with?  - Close friends. \n",
    "### Why these variables are useful:\n",
    "Close friends are a good measure of how often a respondent would keep up with interactions with a person as there is less obligation then with blood relations. This would also include meaningful interactions, although every situation is different. Using the numerical values would also make the graph using linear distribution easier. Firstly, I would create summary statistics of both variables to understand frequencies of the data spread. I would then create both box plots and histograms to understand the spread of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis: \n",
    "Since I do not believe the relationship of both variables to be linear, I would prefer not to use a linear correlation. Instead, I will use confidence intervals to compare the self rated mental health scores across different numbers of friends. \n",
    "### Steps to follow: \n",
    "First I would categorize the data into groups based on the number of friends. Then, I would calculate the mean confidence interval per each group of close friends and display the data and find the 95% confidence interval (between the 25th quartile and 75th quartile). Finally, this can be used to compare this interval to the hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis: \n",
    "A higher number of close friends (3-4) would have a higher mental health score. These results would help prove that in fact more close friends with a good connection to is important in an improved mental health. \n"
